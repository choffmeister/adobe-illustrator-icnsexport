# Adobe Illustrator .icns exporter

This script allows to export icons created in Adobe Illustrator directly to a multiresolution .icns file. It has been tested for CS6.

## Installation

You can just clone/unpack the `icns-export.jsx` file anywhere to your computer and then run it via `File` > `Scripts` > `Other Script...`. If you want the script to occur in the `Scripts` menu permanently, copy the script file to

* Mac OS: /Applications/Adobe lllustrator CS 6/Presets/[language]/Scripts/
* Windows: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe lllustratorCS6\Presets[language]\Scripts\
